#use formated string litterals, called f-strings to get the calculated float number neater ex. 1.6. For these we use curly braces/placeholders {}."y" = what is going to be answered. After ":" comes a formatspecification telling us how it is going to be answered. Follow up with a dot "." ,then "2", means answer with two decimals. Lastly "f" stands for float number. Use d for Integer numbers or nothing at all.

#you can also replace {y:.2f} to {x*x:.2f} directly and skip a line for shorter code

#adding a number before the dot tells you how many big the spaces is going to be printed in the answer
print(f"The square of the number is {y:6.2f}")
# program gives you 6 spaced of which only 4 are used to print numbers
print(f"The square of the number is {y:06.2f}")
# program gives number starting with 0 to fill up the given space

#you can use multiple placeholders in one single f-sting

j=6

#adding "=" after variable to
print (f'{i=} and {j=}')
